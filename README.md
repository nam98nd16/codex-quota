## Features

- Fast account switching across many accounts
- Multi-target apply: set active account for Codex and/or OpenCode in one flow
- Accounts from local app storage, OpenCode auth, and Codex auth
- OAuth authentication via browser
- Two view modes: compact for many accounts, tabs for focused viewing when you have just a few.

```bash
brew install deLiseLINO/tap/codex-quota
```

## Usage

Run the app:

```bash
cq
```

Typical flow:

1. Press `n` to add/import account via OAuth.
2. Move between accounts with arrows.
3. Press `Enter` to open the actions menu for the active account and app-level actions.
4. Press `o` to apply the active account to Codex/OpenCode.
5. Use `r`/`R` to refresh quota and `?` for grouped keyboard help.

## Controls

- `↑` `↓` `←` `→` — both work for navigation; the UI highlights `↑/↓` in compact view and `←/→` in tabs view
- `Enter` — open actions menu for account and app-level actions
- `r` — refresh active account
- `R` — refresh all accounts
- `v` — switch view mode (also available via actions menu)
- `?` — open grouped keyboard help
- `q` / `Ctrl+C` — quit

Additional shortcuts:

- `h` `j` `k` `l` — Vim-style navigation
- `o` — apply active account to Codex/OpenCode
- `i` — toggle additional info
- `n` — add account (OAuth)
- `x` — delete active account
- `u` — open update prompt when an update is available
- `Esc` — close modal/info/error/notice (or quit if nothing is open)
